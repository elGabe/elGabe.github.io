      <description>The Dragon A couple weeks ago I was hanging out with a couple friends talking about all sorts of esoteric things: Art, game design, weird game ideas we had, how the human eye distorts images around your peripheral vision like the inside of a fish-eye lens, that sorta thing. One of those led to my friend Marty recommending I watch some of Chris Crawford&amp;rsquo;s lectures on YouTube. If you are not familiar with him, he is best known for being Atari&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Graphics Wizard&amp;rdquo; in the 80&amp;rsquo;s; having created games like &amp;ldquo;Excalibur&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Eastern Front 1941&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Balance of The Planet&amp;rdquo;, and founding the Game Developer&amp;rsquo;s Conference in his living room way back in 1988.</description>

      <description>About Me My name is Gabe - I&amp;rsquo;m a game designer &amp;amp; music maker based in Ontario, Canada.&#xA;When I&amp;rsquo;m not clocked in working on a AAA game, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about art, science and philosophy, or working on side projects for fun.&#xA;I decided to start this blog thing to have a convenient place to put blurbs on topics I&amp;rsquo;m interested about. Anything from lists of cool drug trip scenes in games, or essays about whatever.</description>

      <description>I am currently stuck in the U.S.A, in a hotel in Irving, Texas waiting for my 4am flight to Charlotte, North Carolina, which will only then take me to Toronto, Ontario (that one&amp;rsquo;s in Canada) and since I now find myself with hours to spend stewing in a small room with some mini-fridge whiskey and and a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese meal paid for by American Airlines, I started thinking about a conversation I had with one of my best friends a while ago.</description>

      <description>For the past two years I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a game designer on a AAA studio, and it&amp;rsquo;s been fantastic so far! I never really imagined working at this scale; in fact at some point - when I was in college - I said &amp;ldquo;I will never work in a huge AAA studio&amp;rdquo;. Hahaha I hope they don&amp;rsquo;t read this.&#xA;In 2021 my work permit in Canada was expiring, which meant if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t found employment in my field I would&amp;rsquo;ve been promptly kicked out of here and back to Brasil.</description>

      <description>One of the things I do a lot is get high and go off on a rant about an incredibly niche topic I find fascinating. I&amp;rsquo;m also incredibly lucky to have friends that not only put up with that, but at times even find that amusing.&#xA;Not every rant is merited, but every now and then something of note comes out of my head. Unfortunately, that is usually forgotten the next day unless someone wrote it down and reminded me of it later.</description>
