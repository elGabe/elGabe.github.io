      <description>I am currently stuck in the U.S.A, in a hotel in Irving, Texas waiting for my 4am flight to Charlotte, North Carolina, which will only then take me to Toronto, Ontario (that one&amp;rsquo;s in Canada) and since I now find myself with hours to spend stewing in a small room with some mini-fridge whiskey and and a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese meal paid for by American Airlines, I started thinking about a conversation I had with one of my best friends a while ago.</description>

      <description>For the past two years I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a game designer on a AAA studio, and it&amp;rsquo;s been fantastic so far! I never really imagined working at this scale; in fact at some point - when I was in college - I said &amp;ldquo;I will never work in a huge AAA studio&amp;rdquo;. Hahaha I hope they don&amp;rsquo;t read this.&#xA;In 2021 my work permit in Canada was expiring, which meant if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t found employment in my field I would&amp;rsquo;ve been promptly kicked out of here and back to Brasil.</description>

      <description>One of the things I do a lot is get high and go off on a rant about an incredibly niche topic I find fascinating. I&amp;rsquo;m also incredibly lucky to have friends that not only put up with that, but at times even find that amusing.&#xA;Not every rant is merited, but every now and then something of note comes out of my head. Unfortunately, that is usually forgotten the next day unless someone wrote it down and reminded me of it later.</description>
